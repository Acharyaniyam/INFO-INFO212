Broadly speaking, there can be three possible reasons: (references: Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data ; Flexible Imputation of Missing Data by R: https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-MCAR.html)\n","\n","1. Missing Completely at Random (MCAR): The missing values on a given variable (Y) are not associated with other variables in a given data set or with the variable (Y) itself. In other words, there is no particular reason for the missing values. An example of MCAR is a weighing scale that ran out of batteries. Some of the data will be missing simply because of bad luck.\n","\n","2. Missing at Random (MAR): MAR occurs when the missingness is not random, but where missingness can be fully accounted for by variables where there is complete information. For example, when placed on a soft surface, a weighing scale may produce more missing values than when placed on a hard surface. Such data are thus not MCAR. If, however, we know surface type and if we can assume MCAR within the type of surface, then the data are MAR.\n","\n","3. Missing Not at Random (MNAR): Missingness depends on unobserved data or the value of the missing data itself. MNAR means that the probability of being missing varies for reasons that are unknown to us. For example, the weighing scale mechanism may wear out over time, producing more missing data as time progresses, but we may fail to note this."],"metadata":{"id":"8vmskTfdg2vI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LusF0VInLUxm"},"source":["## Dealing with Missing Data\n","Missing data are often denoted by a \"na, n/a, N/a, N/A (not applicable)\" or \"Nan, NaN, NAN (not a number)\".
